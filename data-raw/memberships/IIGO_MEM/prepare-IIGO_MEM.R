# Stage one: Collecting data

# Stage two: Correcting data
# In this stage you will want to correct the variable names and
# formats of the 'IIGO_MEM' object until the object created
# below (in stage three) passes all the tests.
# We recommend that you avoid using one letter variable names to keep
# away from issues with ambiguous names down the road.

# manypkgs includes several functions that should help with
# cleaning and standardising your data
# such as `standardise_titles()` and `standardise_texts()`.
# Please see the vignettes or website for more details.

# Stage three: Connecting data
# Next run the following line to make IIGO_MEM available
# within the package.
# This function also does two additional things.
# First, it creates a set of tests for this object to ensure adherence
# to certain standards.
# You can hit Cmd-Shift-T (Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-T (Windows)
# to run these tests locally at any point.
# Any test failures should be pretty self-explanatory
# and may require you to return to stage two and further clean,
# standardise, or wrangle your data into the expected format.
# Second, it also creates a documentation file for you to fill in.
# Please note that the export_data() function requires a .bib file to be
# present in the data_raw folder of the package for citation purposes.
# Therefore, please make sure that you have permission to use the dataset
# that you're including in the package.
# To add a template of .bib file to the package,
# please run `manypkgs::add_bib("memberships", "IIGO_MEM")`.
